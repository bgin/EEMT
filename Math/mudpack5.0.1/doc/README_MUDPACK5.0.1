MUDPACK Version 5.0.1
----------------------
Multigrid Software for Solving Elliptic Partial Differential Equations

12/06/2011

Author:  John  Adams, National Center for Atmospheric Research

Version
-------
This MUDPACK distribution is identical with the one dated 12/06/2011, 
except for this present file; thus we have not  changed the version 
mumber. It remains at 5.0.1.

Caveats
-------
MUDPACK 5.0.1 is written in Fortran 77 and 90 but it may not fully comply 
with either Fortran standard. We have not run the code through a rigorous
standards checker, other than the various compilers we have used in building
the code. Users whose applications require strict adherence to the standard 
must provide this assurance themselves.

This distribution is intended for use on Linux and Unix systems.  
The included Makefile is not compatible with Windows makefiles.

Support
-------
NCAR offers no support for this package.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is provided in file MUDPACK5.0.1.html and companion image file 
Stackedgrid.gif.  Use your browser to open the file and navigate its links to 
view the usage documentation of the user-level routines.

Building the Library
--------------------
Our Makefile requires the following: a Unix or Linux or Mac operating system, gmake, 
and a Fortran 90 compiler.  If successful, this Makefile builds a static library 
libmudpack.a and several binary executables.

Examine file make.inc to see if your OS and compiler are represented.  If they 
are not, you should modify file make.inc and the Makefile in each directory 
(main, src and test) according to your compiler's needs.

The source code is written for single precision real numbers. If you desire double 
precision floating-point arithmetic, you should modify Makefile and make.inc with 
compiler options for promoting single to double precision.  Your compiler's user 
guide will have information on the required compiler options.
