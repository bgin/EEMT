# Electromagnetic Engineering Modeling Toolkit

This project provides a high-fidelity simulation framework for Radar,Telecommunication and the other Radio-frequency engineering systems. The goal is to achieve realistic, design-level system modeling and simulation, following standards and methodologies found in advanced engineering and technical literature.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive System Modeling:**  
  Models core components of Radar and Telecommunication systems , including analytical Radar Cross Section (RCS) calculations and antennae radiation patterns.  
- **Performance-Optimized Kernels:**  
  Implements highly optimized algorithms, leveraging Intel Intrinsics (SSE/AVX/AVX2/AVX512) for massive manual vectorization. Compiler-level autovectorization is used for descriptive statistics and profiling.
- **GPGPU Acceleration:**  
  Includes a substantial CUDA codebase (~15,000 lines) covering computational kernels and helper routines for GPU-accelerated simulation.
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  Organized as a collection of standalone modules, each describing distinct modeled components. The library can serve as a computational backend or be integrated with a GUI frontend.
- **Component Scope:**  
  The framework is structured around four main simulation domains:
  1. RF Telecommunication system modeling and simulation
  2. Radar modeling and simulation
  3. Digital Signal Processing
  4. Support libraries (e.g. an Atmosphere and Radiative Transfer)
  
## Implementation Overview

- **SIMD Execution Paths:**  
  Hundreds of computational kernels implemented for both double and single precision, focusing on analytical RCS and antenna modeling.
- **CUDA Path:**  
  GPU kernels for large-scale, high-performance computations.
- **Current Status:**  
  The project contains hundreds of SIMD kernels and a comprehensive set of analytical and simulation tools for radar and Telecom system analysis and modeling.
